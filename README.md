# dpi_checker_gui
A gui version of dpi_checker (my first go at using egui)

# usage
- Recommended to be in fullscreen
- Adjust the settings. Use a lower but physically measurable distance if your dpi is very high.
- Click on the plot anywhere to start your mouse move. Once moved in any direction, click again to start the calculation

# todo
- right now, you must end in the plot area, can be fixed to end anywhere the user may wish.
